# Pyrdle

Pyrdle is a command line clone of the popular word guessing game Wordle, designed for Assessment 2 of Unit ICTPRG302.

## Description

Pyrdle gives the player 6 chances to guess a five letter word. After 6 chances, or when the player guesses a word correctly, the program will award a score out of 100 to indicate how 'well' the game was played.

Pyrdle takes into consideration multiple of the same letter appearing, duplicate words, improper guess length and can read any word list put through to it (well, almost).
Pyrdle is open source to ensure complete security and transparancy of under the hood.
